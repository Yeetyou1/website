notes for myself:

ABOUT ME
-on about me page do icons for the programming language(s) [that i know] instead of typing them out normally for readability

FONTS
-.woff2 and .woff are the most compatible, .ttf / .otf are not recommended for websites but could be used
    inter google font (closest google font to SF)
    add support for SF on ONLY apple devices as self-hosting it is illegal

    main font = inter google font
    "nfs unbound font" = versus online-font | versus ultra is the most comparible but thats paid and i'm broke
        learn how to access them from their servers and not upload onto the actual gitihub cause it won't do commits for some reason
    
FAVICON
-gotta have a favicon

LAYOUT AND DESIGN
-flex boxes are killing me
    maybe it's time to switch to a different .css or figure something out?
-ask [] to rip some neocities / dev portfolio websites and look at how they do it
