ABOUT ME PAGE FILE
-on about me page do icons for the programming language(s) [that i know] instead of typing them out normally for readability

FONTS
-.woff2 and .woff are the most compatible, .ttf / .otf are not recommended for websites but could be used
    ● add support for San Fransico font on ONLY apple devices as self-hosting it is illegal
    ● main font = inter google font
    ● "nfs unbound font" = versus font (versus ultra is the most comparible but thats paid and i'm broke)
        ▶ learn how to access them from their servers and not upload onto the actual gitihub because it won't do commits for some reason and is highly ineffecient
    ● code font = google_sans_code

FAVICON
-gotta have a favicon
